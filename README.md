## 🚀 Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- Real-time visual feedback of input and result
- Input parentheses for advanced expressions
- Error handling for invalid expressions
- Easy-to-use graphical interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Tkinter (Standard GUI library in Python)

## 📦 Installation

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it here: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Clone this repository:

bash
`git clone https://github.com/genesisvaca/Calculator.git
cd Calculator`

## ▶️ How to Run
Run the following command:

bash
`python3 main.py`
The calculator window will appear. Click the buttons to input values and calculate results.

## 🧠 How It Works
The GUI consists of:

Text widget to display current input/result.

Button widgets to input digits, operations, clear or evaluate the expression.

Functions to handle appending values, clearing, and evaluating the calculation using eval().

## 📌 Notes
The eval() function is used to evaluate the string expression. It works well in this controlled environment but should be avoided in real-world apps that process user input for security reasons.

Designed for educational/demo purposes.
